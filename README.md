My first customer project. I utilized CSS and HTML to build a responsive landing page.

## Tech used: ![HTML5 BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=HTML5&color=23555f&style=plastic&logo=html5)![CSS BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=CSS3&color=285f65&style=plastic&logo=css3)

My learning was focused on a clean product that showcased my frontend abilities, listening to what the customer wanted and delivering.

## Optimizations
I am working on building out a 3 page site for this company.

## Lessons Learned:

I dealt with a customer for the first time it was a great experience, I will use a contract next time to keep things clear and organized.
